# ARCCENA Logo Setup Instructions

## To complete the logo integration:

1. Save your ARCCENA logo image as `logo.png` in the `public/images/` folder
2. The logo should be in PNG format with transparent background for best results
3. Recommended size: 200x200 pixels or larger (the CSS will scale it appropriately)

## File structure should be
```
public/
  images/
    logo.png  <-- Your ARCCENA logo goes here
```

## Logo Features Implemented

- Responsive sizing (60px desktop, 50px tablet, 45px mobile)
- Glassmorphism container with backdrop blur
- Hover animations with subtle rotation and scaling
- Consistent design in both header and footer
- Electric blue glow effects on hover
- Proper aspect ratio maintenance

The logo will automatically appear in both the navigation header and footer once you place the file in the correct location.
